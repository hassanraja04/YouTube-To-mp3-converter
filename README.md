# YouTube to MP3 Converter

This is a passion project created by me, which takes a YouTube link and converts it to an MP3 file. 

### üöÄ Project Overview
This converter allows users to input a YouTube link, process the video, and download the audio as an MP3. The code was initially designed to be hosted online; however, due to the associated backend hosting costs, it is now available to run locally.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- **Frontend**: The frontend provides an easy interface to paste a YouTube link, convert it, and download the MP3 file. 
- **Backend**: The backend handles the video conversion and audio extraction process. Initially designed to work on cloud services, the backend must now be hosted locally due to cost constraints.

### üõ†Ô∏è Running the Project Locally
To run this project locally, please refer to this repository:  
üîó [YouTube-To-Mp3-Converter-For-Local-Use](https://github.com/hassanraja04/YouTube-To-Mp3-Converter-For-Local-Use.git)

The repository above contains step-by-step instructions on how to set up the project on your local machine, including how to run both the frontend and backend components.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
While this repository contains the main code, it cannot be run online without a working backend. Due to the running costs of hosting the backend service, the live conversion feature is disabled. However, you can clone the code and run it locally for full functionality.

### üìù Original Overview
Initially, this project was built using the `pytube` module to fetch YouTube videos and extract audio. The MP3 file would then be saved locally to a "Converter" folder on the desktop. Over time, it evolved into a more robust solution with a frontend and backend to handle the full conversion and download process.
